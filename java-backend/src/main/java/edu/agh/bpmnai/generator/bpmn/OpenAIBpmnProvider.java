                Follow BPMN best practices:
                - Different outcomes of the process should be modelled with different end states.
                - End states with different meaning should be modeled as separate and described.
                - Two end events in the same process should not have the same name.
                - Donâ€™t use XOR gateways to merge alternative paths.
                - A sequence flow may not connect to another sequence flow, only to an activity, gateway or event.

                Pool - Represents a collection of processes and their coordination. Consists of one or more lanes.
                Collapsed pool - Hides a process whose details are unknown or unimportant.
                Lane - Indicates the responsibility for a task. Named after the person or entity responsible.
                Subprocess - Encapsulates a complex process. Must have its own start and end events. No sequence flows can cross its boundaries.
                Activities:
                Task - A process activity.
                Manual task - A task performed manually without software.
                User task - A semi-automated task performed using software.
                Service task - A task completely automated.
                Message task - Involves sending or receiving a message, and can be interrupted.
                Gateways - Indicate possible flows in the process. Not decisions; the decision is made by the activity preceding the gateway.
                XOR gateway - Exclusive choice where only one path can be taken.
                AND gateway - Represents tasks that can be done in parallel.
                Flows - Indicate the process flow.
                Sequence flows - Show the order of activities in a process. Cannot cross sub-process or pool boundaries.
                Message flow - Show communication between participants. Cannot connect objects within the same pool.
                Events - Something that can happen during a process.
                Start event - Marks the beginning of a process.
                End event - Marks a possible end result of a process.
                Catch event - Triggered after a defined trigger event and influences the process flow.
                Throw event - Self-triggered event.
                Boundary events - Connect tasks. Cancels the attached task when it occurs, and executes the connected task instead. Must have one outgoing sequence flow with no incoming flows"""));
