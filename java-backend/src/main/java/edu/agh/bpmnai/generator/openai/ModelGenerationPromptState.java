                        Follow BPMN best practices:
                        - Different outcomes of the process should be modelled with different end states.
                        - End states with different meaning should be modeled as separate and described.
                        - Two end events in the same process should not have the same name.
                        - Donâ€™t use XOR gateways to merge alternative paths.
                        - A sequence flow may not connect to another sequence flow, only to an activity, gateway or event.

                        Description of available BPMN elements:
                        Pool - Represents a collection of processes and their coordination. Consists of one or more lanes.
                        Collapsed pool - Hides a process whose details are unknown or unimportant.
                        Lane - Indicates the responsibility for a task. Named after the person or entity responsible.
                        Subprocess - Encapsulates a complex process. Must have its own start and end events. No sequence flows can cross its boundaries.
                        Activities:
                        Task - A process activity.
                        Manual task - A task performed manually without software.
                        User task - A semi-automated task performed using software.
                        Service task - A task completely automated.
                        Message task - Involves sending or receiving a message, and can be interrupted.
                        Gateways - Indicate possible flows in the process. Not decisions; the decision is made by the activity preceding the gateway.
                        XOR gateway - Exclusive choice where only one path can be taken.
                        AND gateway - Represents tasks that can be done in parallel.
                        Flows - Indicate the process flow.
                        Sequence flows - Show the order of activities in a process. Cannot cross sub-process or pool boundaries.
                        Message flow - Show communication between participants. Cannot connect objects within the same pool.
                        Events - Something that can happen during a process.
                        Start event - Marks the beginning of a process.
                        End event - Marks a possible end result of a process.
                        Catch event - Triggered after a defined trigger event and influences the process flow.
                        Throw event - Self-triggered event.
                        Boundary events - Connect tasks. Cancels the attached task when it occurs, and executes the connected task instead. Must have one outgoing sequence flow with no incoming flows""")
